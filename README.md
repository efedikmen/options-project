# On my vision for the project

I want to create a tool to not only price European options, but also to graph the value and the greeks versus the change in input variables. 

I need to find how the greeks are calculated for European options on futures and forex. 

The next step is to produce the desired graphs. I can delve deeper by thinking about 3d graphs.
